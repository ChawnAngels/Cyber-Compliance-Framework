# **Cyber-Compliance-Framework**

The **Cyber-Compliance-Framework** is an open-source security and legal-compliance auditing toolkit.  
It analyzes network configurations, security policies, and device settings, then evaluates them against major cybersecurity and regulatory standards such as **NIST**, **HIPAA**, **GDPR**, and the **FTC Safeguards Rule**.

This project showcases the intersection of **network engineering**, **cybersecurity**, and **legal compliance** designed for future tech law workflows and automated auditing.

##  Purpose of This Project

Modern organizations need tools that help bridge the gap between:

- technical security controls  
- and legal/regulatory requirements  

This framework aims to:

- automate compliance checks  
- reduce manual auditing effort  
- help identify misconfigurations  
- provide understandable compliance reports  

It is designed to grow into a modular, expandable compliance engine.
